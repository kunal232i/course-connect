## Frontend

To set up and run the frontend, follow the instructions provided in the [Frontend README](https://github.com/kunal232i/course-connect/blob/main/frontend/README.md).

The frontend is built using React and Vite, utilizing Material UI for a better user experience. It communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD operations on courses.

## Backend

To set up the backend, follow the instructions provided in the [Backend README](https://github.com/kunal232i/course-connect/blob/main/backend/README.md).

The backend is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and provides the necessary APIs for managing courses and user authentication.

Please ensure that you have MongoDB installed and running before setting up the backend locally.
